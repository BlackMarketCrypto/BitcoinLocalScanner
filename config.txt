# Bitcoin Local Scanner v1.0 Configuration File
# Edit these settings to customize the scanner behavior

# ===== GENERAL SETTINGS =====
# Number of CPU threads to use for scanning
# Recommended: Set to your CPU core count or slightly less
# Default: 8 (adjust based on your system)
num_threads = 8

# Number of wallets to scan (0 = infinite scanning)
# Set to a specific number to limit the scan
target_wallets = 0

# Enable multiple address types (BIP44, BIP49, BIP84)
# true = Check Legacy, SegWit, and Native SegWit addresses (slower but comprehensive)
# false = Check only Legacy addresses (faster)
multiple_addresses = true

# ===== BLOCKCHAIN SETTINGS =====
# Path to Bitcoin Core blockchain data directory
# This should point to the 'blocks' folder in your Bitcoin Core installation
# Windows default: C:\Users\%USERNAME%\AppData\Roaming\Bitcoin\blocks
# Custom example: D:\Bitcoin\blocks
# Leave empty to use online APIs (slower and requires internet)
bitcoin_blockchain_path = C:\Bitcoin\blocks

# ===== OUTPUT SETTINGS =====
# File to save wallets with balance
output_file = bitcoin_wallets_with_balance.txt

# Database file to track checked seed phrases (prevents duplicates)
database_file = checked_seeds.db

# ===== PERFORMANCE SETTINGS =====
# Enable real-time dashboard display
dashboard_enabled = true

# Dashboard update interval in seconds
dashboard_update_interval = 1

# ===== ADVANCED SETTINGS =====
# Scan timeout in seconds (0 = no timeout)
scan_timeout = 0

# Enable memory optimization (may reduce performance slightly)
memory_optimization = false

# Enable verbose logging
verbose_logging = false

# ===== NOTES =====
# - Ensure Bitcoin Core is installed and fully synchronized for best performance
# - Higher thread counts may improve speed but use more system resources
# - Multiple address types increase chances of finding wallets but slow down scanning
# - Keep this file secure as it contains your scanner configuration
